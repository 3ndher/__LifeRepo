Of cource i havent tried to kill my self. everyone knows its the cowards way out. But ive experienced it. 
she died taking a heros dose. and i lost myself for 4 years after that. 
eventually i got to the point where now im sure there is no death... for me
but for everyone else you are. and you hurt them every time you try. and it gets compounded because the weight of their greif will trancend universes

i cant tell you how i know this. but i do.
look you dont mean enough to me for me to change your life for you. but you mean enough for me to help you.
but not if you keep bringing me down with you. drown yourslef but i will not let you kill me too.
