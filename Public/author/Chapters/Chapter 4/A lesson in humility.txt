I kind of want this book to be a compilation of letters. but instead of letters its a bunch of drunk sage advice you get on the train home.

Chapter IV
A lesson in humility

This is a more nuanced account of one of my favorite stories of our ancestors.
Homo sapiens and neandertals lived together in harmony. XD
But the point of the story is that while homo sapiens and neandertals lived in the same time period the neandertals stayed near water sources and built communities. While the homos went out galivanting and died. This doesn’t seem significant until you expand time and find that homo sapiens survived the extinctions leading to - in effect you being a homo sapiens living like a neandertal.
Put out that aside for now. 

How is that a lesson in humility. 
We are better than our neighbor while being worse than our peer while all the while still being able to do all the same things as one another. That is how this lesson can make sense
	you work hard - you get results
	you work harder - you get more results
	you work a lot harder - more linear results
	you learn more - results may vary
	you practice - random results (more results)
	you practice more - you lose more
	you experiment - you learn
	you result - knowledge
	linear growing consciousness - exponential results

The human mind cannot fathom the exponent and that’s what makes it godly. exponentials essentially make it so the rules are different.
It is a hard lesson to learn that hard work does not always even yield results. Everyone works; everyone gets results. But results rarely come out equivalent. That’s where humility comes in. We are all the same so we are all able to put the same amount in but we all get something different in return. But once you see the beauty of putting it in you grow to be more humble in the results. 

Trust me I’m not a capitalist.
