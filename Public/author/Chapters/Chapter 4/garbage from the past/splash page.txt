a lesson in humility:

you work hard - you get results
you work harder - you get more results
you work a lot harder - more linear results
you learn more - results may varry
you practice - random results (more results)
you practice more - you lose more
you experiment - you learn
you result - kowledge
linear growing conciousness - exponential results


uncomporehendable changes are exponential results. we are all uncomprehendable exponential gods. 
but we are all human
untold riches 
god status
breaks reality

i like this story because it mirrors an old story of what separated homosapeians from neandertals they stayed near the water sources and built comminities while homos went galivanting and died. but the homo sapiens survived the exinctions.



keep in mind that we can keep the assumptions im going to keep surviving. i took another step forward i can keep taking steps. 
you can keep taking steps until you are dead



in the end your work hard does not always get results.
you might not make it to the first step. but the point is you get to try.
and evryone gets to try

all these are true statements
this is suppposed to be a journey or truths








I kind of want this book to be a compilation of letters. but instead of letters its a bunch of drunk sage advice you get on the train home.

Chapter IV
A lesson in humility

This is a more numanced account of one of my favorite sotries of our ancestors.
Homosapiens and neandertals lived together in harmonry. XD
But the point of the story is that while homosapienes and neandertals lived in the same time period the neandertals stayed near water sources, and built comunities. While the homos went out galivanting and died. This doesnt seem significant until you expand time and find that homo sapienes survuved the extinctions leading to in effect you being a homosapien and living like a neandertal.
Put out that aside for now. 

How is that a lesson in humility. 
We are better than our neighbor while being worse than our peer while all the while still being able to do all the same things as one another. That is how this lesson can make sense:
	you work hard - you get results
	you work harder - you get more results
	you work a lot harder - more linear results
	you learn more - results may varry
	you practice - random results (more results)
	you practice more - you lose more
	you experiment - you learn
	you result - kowledge
	linear growing conciousness - exponential results

The human mind cannot fathom an exponent and thats what makes it godly. exponentials essentially make it so the rules are different.
Hard work does not always even yeild results. Everyone works; evryone gets results. But results rarely come out equivalent. Thats where humility comes in. We are all the same so we are all able to put the same amount in but we all get something different in return. But once you see the beaulty of putting it in you grow to be more humble in the results. 

Trust me im not a capitalist.
