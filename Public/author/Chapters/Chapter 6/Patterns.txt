Chapter 6: Patterns


why are humans so good at recognizing patterns?
it is said we are hard wired to recognize faces. we see haces in everything. even burnt toast. The working theory is that we have retained this evolved ability because
it was imparitive to recognize faces in ambiguous settings to survive. (picture of man hiding ina bush, jesus toast, dark panther in the night)

I belive this face recognition is just a by product of our primary core skill: pattern recognition. 
    Finding patters. Diciphering the direction and determining trends. "Guessing" the most benneficial end point and determining how to follow
    the trend to your desired outcome. 

Are patterns circular? Does history repeat itself? Does your history repeat itself? Is it a circular pattern or paradox with which you cannot escape?
    Breake the circle. Rise above. There are only 2 ways out of a paradox. (a stable control system of missery)
    2 ways out and 3 potential courses of action. That is a 66% chance of happieness at any given point in time. But if you are willing to take 
    a walk with me on this journey to more success then youcan find 100% happieness. 

So why would we be so good at recognizing patterns? I think its because <private>.goto(~/___/___/___/private/UFC/UFC6/patterns.exe)
