this one is tricky 
while i see my mom more as my guide. i have many more stories about how she has been fundamental to my
development. every time i have learned something that seems important to me
(likely because it is something unfounded to me) it came from my mom

I see myself as more in the image of my dad. It is possible that because of this i cant differentiate 
between what is mine and what came from him
i cant pinpoint anything sacred that came from him because i belive its already mine
I could look at it both way. I got nothing from him and i got everything from him.

This makes it more fun tho when hanging out with my parents and I bring up things about myself and
then we reveal oh haha thats the same and i got it from one or the other of them.
There was that time when i told my parents that i couldnt hold a rythm because i liked hanging out
with musicians (like they did) and any time i was included i couldnt come close to maintaining 
anfd my dad told me i got that from my mom XD

it was also interesting to  realize. that my idea of a good time, and my general rtoutine when going
out with my friends is almost the exact same as my parents. pregame, hang out, walk to the music,
walk back and grab a big slice of pizza.
