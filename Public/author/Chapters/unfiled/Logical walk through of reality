Logical walk through of reality

Stage1: Physics
    Matter is a wave.
    All particles follow the wave function.
    Continuous concious observation determins states and existance.



All matter is a wave. Particles can 'appear' in a vaccum.
The nature of Electrons behaving as waves makes me think they can
'phase' in and out of space time. meaning they can travel through time.
There are a number of experiments substantiating this idea.

Where does a thought come from?
What causes actions we take?
Implses.
What are passing thoughts? Where do they come from?
Random electorns activating nureons and cascading reactions?

Are you in control of your toughts?
What about passing thoughts?
Who is in control of them

What in life has potentials of electrons or common electron paths
Interactions with them. What are senders and receivers? And who is on The
other end?




We are college roomate. We are running an experiment
monitoring a wave
a particle. Both watching it. The goal is to get one to determine 
a definite path and another to leave it in determinant. Collapsed for one 
and still around for another. 
Is the answer simply trust. How can you trust that the particle and wave is 
behaving the way the other says? How can we confirm it?
This is the two general problem.
