niche said god is dead and we killed him
is this literal or parabol as everything religious is

the interesting part is that this may be false. and you can prove it
it seems A(from wise crack video on rick and morty) that killing god may just 
be the concious rejection of them
but can this even actually happen
simply declare yourself athiest and move on?
but can you actually reomve the thought of god after learning about it?
you cant control your subconcious and how you subconciouosly act

"the only way to be truly happy is to make others happy" - WIlliam Carlos Williams
Can one experience happieness within themselves? or can it only be seen outrside of you
when i experience great happieness i find that i have the intense urge to give it to others
like it cannot be contained in me
or maybe i instinctively know that happieness is fleeting
it is something that exits in time that by defn will end
so giving it to others when you have it is like a way of being able to store it somewhere
else that you can then return to retrive at a later date
the same principle can be extrapolated to knowledge
you cant rememeber or do everything. it is important to try so that you learn you can
but after that its more important to rely outwardly. once you grow to a certain size youy 
are limited by the discrete size that you capped at after puberty
if you were to keep growing you would likely be the smartest man in the world but there is
a size restriction to life especially human life and would only limit the lifespan you
have access to
so when your world grows (as it must to feel fulfilled) how can you keep up with the 
expansion when you are physically incapable of it. simply double your size by relying on the
community
