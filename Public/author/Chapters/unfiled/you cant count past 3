you cant count past 3

civilizations usually do not have a number systems that extends past 3
they have no words to describe numbers so mathematics is normally very simple
in our understanding of the word but they also are intuitively capable of math
like all people are
they count single items, double items (a pair, or both) and then usually just 'many'
so if you have 4 of something they articulate it the same as if there are 3 or 5
It is also noteworthy to note that the human brain does not count intuitively
after there are 3 items your ability to eyeball a number of objects infront of 
you drops off drastically.
3 is a magic number because there is nothing higher than that number
i said before that the human brain cannot fathom the exponent and I do still mean 
this but it is also intuitive because the natural world is built on exponentials 
and is equally unfathomable
You can start to eye ball numbers easier when you start to group them
when we use tallys we group in 5s but its the same concept. when you get to numbers
that are greater than 3 it is easier to just group them and express as multiples or 
exponents. 
the mayans must have been in a similar situation because they used a base 3 number system
started off in i similar manor to these primitive tribes that have essentuially exisated outside of time and not evolved in complexity. but when the mayan civilization began to grow
they needed to invent such a number system. I assume the most natural way to do this would 
be to maintain the current language system and only invent exponets. ironically simply 
adding a new concept to the language system refelxively created the potential for 
exponential growth in their society.
